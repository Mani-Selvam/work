## WORKLOGIX – MASTER SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS

### 1. System Purpose

WorkLogix is a multi-company (multi-tenant), server-time-controlled automated attendance, productivity, performance, and rewards platform. The system provides a dedicated admin dashboard, automated workflows, and real-time transparency for both employees and managers, with all actions, analytics, and rewards processed end-to-end—no manual loopholes or hidden actions.

***

### 2. Core Work Timings

- **Work Start:** 9:00 AM (server time)
- **Work End:** 6:00 PM (server time)
- **Attendance Window:** 9:00 AM–10:00 AM (flexible arrival)
    - *Slightly Late:* 9:01–9:15 AM
    - *Late:* 9:16–10:00 AM
    - *Very Late:* After 10:00 AM (marked present, but streak/points lost)
    - *Absent:* If not logged in by 10:00 AM (configurable as per strict attendance)
- **Overtime:** After 6:00 PM (server time), auto-calculated by logout
- **Grace Period:** 5–10 minutes (optional, per company config)

- **Login button is always visible – no UI restriction on login/logout.**

***

### 3. Employee (User) Portal

#### User Controls

- **Login Button:** Always available; attendance strictly via server time.
- **Logout Button:** Always available; logs out instantly regardless of when clicked, with exact time recorded.
- **Daily Work Report:** Can be submitted anytime after tasks are completed; links to "tasks_reports" table; enables instant logout; marks day as “Work Completed”.
- **User Dashboard:** Shows:
    - Today's login/logout
    - Working hours
    - Attendance status, late/absent/leave/overtime markers
    - Points, streaks, badges
    - Productivity status
    - Report status
    - Color-coded 7-day and monthly attendance calendar/history
- **Attendance History:** Last 7 days (color-coded), plus monthly overview
- **Self-Service Issue Management:**
    - Request login/logout correction
    - Apply for leave
    - Submit late explanations (admin reviews/acts)
- **No manual attendance edits by user; all logs/points automated by server.**

#### Automated System Logic

- **On Login:** Attendance status determined instantly by server time, streaks/points updated, late/absent handled per rules.
- **On Logout:** Working hours/overtime calculated, day-level points/productivity/streak status updated, "task completion" status linked if report submitted.
- **Auto-Logout Scenarios:**
    - Company cut-off time +1hr (7:00 PM default)
    - >2 hr inactivity
    - System detects browser crash/device shutdown
    - Cron task at night enforces logout if still active
- **All automation prevents manual gaming of system.**

***

### 4. Admin Portal: Dual-View System

#### (A) Overall Attendance Dashboard

- Overview of all employees daily:
    - Name, Role, Status, Login/Logout, Working Hours, Overtime, Points, Report status
    - Filters: status, department, date range, etc.
    - Real-time auto-refresh
    - "View Details" action for deep drilldown per member

#### (B) Individual Attendance Profile

- **Personal Info:** Name, ID, department, role, joining date, work mode
- **Monthly Calendar:** Attendance, leave, holidays, overtime, report status, with color-coded markers
- **Full Daily Logs Table:** Each day's login/logout, hours, overtime, status, notes, report
- **Editable by Admin:** Correction buttons for login/logout/times/remarks; can add attendance, manage holidays/leaves, and add notes
- **Performance Analytics:** Full stats: total working/productivity days, avg login/logout, overtime/late/absent, best streak, performance and productivity index, streaks, badges, progress
- **Exportable:** PDF downloads for any view
- **All admin actions are audit-logged for transparency.**

***

### 5. Admin Workflow

- Dashboard → Today's overview
- "View Details" → deep-dive into user record, drill down, edit or act on entries
- Back to overview

- **Admin can:** Correct attendances, approve/reject leave, add manual holidays/attendance, export reports, manage all analytics and reward settings.

***

### 6. Automation (Backend Cron Jobs)

**Daily (Post 6PM):**  
- Mark late/very late/absent
- Auto logout
- Calculate daily hours, overtime, scores, streaks, productivity
- Email daily summary to employees and managers

**Weekly:**
- Auto leaderboard, weekly summary email with top/bottom performers and suggestions

**Monthly:**
- Award achievement badges (Perfect Month, Early Bird, Reliable Performer, Overtime Warrior)
- Publish monthly leaderboard
- Monthly performance analytics to admins
- (Optional): Reset points per config

**NO MANUAL INTERVENTION NEEDED – all flows automated**

***

### 7. Database Schema (Core Tables)

- companies
- users
- attendance_logs
- attendance_rewards
- leaves
- holidays
- tasks_reports
- auto_tasks
- badges
- company_settings
- user_settings
- performance_scores
- streak_logs

**All tables cross-referenced, audit-logged. No missing entity.**

***

### 8. Multi-Tenancy

- Each company: own rules, employees, holiday/leave list, reward structure, time zone, dashboards, data separation
- **Super Admin:** Full cross-company control and analytics; cannot access individual company’s private data directly without audit trail.
