You don’t want to change the existing Company Registration procedure (which generates and emails a unique Company ID like CMP-XYZ123).

You just want to extend the same flow with extra frontend fields for more company details — while keeping the Company ID generation + email flow exactly as it is.

Here’s your final, complete structure 👇

🏢 Company Registration Form (Final Structure)
🎯 Purpose

To register a new company in the system and automatically generate a unique Company ID (e.g. CMP-XYZ123) which is then emailed to the company admin after successful registration.
