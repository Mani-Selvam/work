WorkLogix –   Company member Attendance & Reward Management Structure (Final Version) 
 

🧩 1️⃣ System Purpose

WorkLogix provides an automated attendance and reward system for every registered company.
Each company has its own attendance tracking, working hours policy, and reward automation — with no manual operations.

🕒 2️⃣ Core Work Timings
Schedule	Time
🕘 Work Start	9:00 AM
🕕 Work End	6:00 PM
⏰ Attendance Window	9:00 AM – 10:00 AM
💤 Late Entry	After 9:15 AM (till 10:00 AM)
❌ Absent	No entry after 10:00 AM
🌙 Overtime	Work after 6:00 PM (auto-calculated)
🧍‍♂️ 3️⃣ Company Member (Employee) Side

Employees (Company Members) interact mainly with the Attendance Portal — designed for automatic tracking and self-view.

🔹 Features
Feature	Description
🕘 Mark Attendance (Auto)	Attendance marked automatically when user logs in between 9:00–10:00 AM.
⏱️ Auto Time Tracking	System calculates total working hours and late entry.
📅 Daily Status View	User can view “Present”, “Late”, or “Absent” per day.

📊 Monthly Report	Shows attendance graph, streaks, points, and badges.
📧 Email Notifications	Daily summary and monthly appreciation emails auto-sent.
💡 Employee Side Flow

Login using Google or manual credentials.

When login time is recorded → attendance is automatically marked.

System checks:

Login time (before 9:00 = ✅ On-time)

Between 9:01–10:00 = ⚠️ Late

After 10:00 = ❌ Absent

Automatically updates daily attendance table.

End of the day → logout time captured → total hours saved.

Rewards / streaks update auto-run at night (via cron job).

✅ ADMIN PANEL
1. User Management
✅ Add New User

Admin can add a new user.

After adding → user card displays:
Name, Email, UserID, Password, Role, Status (Active/Removed)

✅ View Details Button

Click View Details → Modal shows:

Name

Email

User ID

Password

Join Date

Status

Edit / Remove Buttons

✅ This is correct.

✅ User Removal → Auto Logout

Current Problem:

Admin removes a user ❌ but that user still stays logged in.

✅ Correct Structure:
When admin clicks Remove User:

Update database → status = "deleted" or isActive = false

Emit event OR check status in backend on each API call

When user tries ANY action → backend returns:

401: User Disabled


Frontend force logout:

localStorage.clear();
navigate("/login");


✅ User instantly logged out automatically in all devices + tabs.

2. Company Settings
❌ Problem 1:

Company basic info loads only first time but not refreshing.

✅ Fix Structure:
Every time admin opens Settings:

Fetch /company/info

Display latest data

Add “Refresh Info” button if needed

❌ Problem 2:

Close button not working.

✅ Fix:
Modal should have:

onClose={() => setOpen(false)}

3. Attendees Module
❌ Current Issues:

User attendance visible only on user side

Admin cannot see attendance list

Performance not visible

When user logs in, their name does NOT appear in admin attendees list

✅ Correct Structure:

✅ Admin Attendees Overview:

Admin should see all employees:

Name

Present Days

Absent Days

Performance Score

Total Hours

Last Login Time

Today’s Status (Present / Absent)

✅ Click user → View Complete Attendance

Modal or Page shows:

Monthly attendance

Leave count

Login time history

Performance graph

✅ When user logs in:

Create attendance entry:

date: TODAY
loginTime: Date.now()
status: "Present"


Display immediately under admin Attendees page.

4. Dashboard Overview
❌ Bug:

Admin removes a user but dashboard still shows old total count.

✅ Fix Structure:

Dashboard fetch should be:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users WHERE isActive = true;


Not:

COUNT(all users)

✅ USER PANEL
1. General

✅ All fine.

2. User Attendance Portal
❌ Current Issue:

User login → attendance not created
Present/Absent not showing

✅ Correct Behavior:

✅ When User Logs In:

Automatically create entry:

{
   userId: "",
   date: TODAY,
   status: "Present",
   loginTime: current time,
   logoutTime: null
}

✅ When User Clicks Logout:

Update same record:

logoutTime: current time


✅ Admin must see this instantly.

3. Daily Attendance Lock

Problem:

User logs out → logs in again → attendance resets incorrectly

✅ Correct Structure:

Rules:

One day → ONE attendance record only

If user logs out and logs in again on the same day
✅ Do NOT create new record
✅ Just update login and logout times

Structure:

if (existingRecordForToday) {
    update record (new login/logout time)
} else {
    create new attendance record
}

✅ SUMMARY (Short & Clean)
✅ Admin

User remove → auto logout

User details modal fix

Company settings refresh + close button fix

Admin attendees must list all users + their performance

Dashboard total users should count only ACTIVE users

✅ User

Login → create today attendance

Logout → update same attendance entry

Re-login same day → DO NOT create new entry

Status (present/absent) visible to admin instantly
