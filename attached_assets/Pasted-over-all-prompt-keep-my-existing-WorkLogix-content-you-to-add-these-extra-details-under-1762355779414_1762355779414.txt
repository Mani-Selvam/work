WorkLogix –   Company member Attendance & Reward Management Structure (Final Version) 
 

🧩 1️⃣ System Purpose

WorkLogix provides an automated attendance and reward system for every registered company.
Each company has its own attendance tracking, working hours policy, and reward automation — with no manual operations.

🕒 2️⃣ Core Work Timings
Schedule	Time
🕘 Work Start	9:00 AM
🕕 Work End	6:00 PM
⏰ Attendance Window	9:00 AM – 10:00 AM
💤 Late Entry	After 9:15 AM (till 10:00 AM)
❌ Absent	No entry after 10:00 AM
🌙 Overtime	Work after 6:00 PM (auto-calculated)
🧍‍♂️ 3️⃣ Company Member (Employee) Side

Employees (Company Members) interact mainly with the Attendance Portal — designed for automatic tracking and self-view.

🔹 Features
Feature	Description
🕘 Mark Attendance (Auto)	Attendance marked automatically when user logs in between 9:00–10:00 AM.

💡 Employee Side Flow

Login using Google or manual credentials.

When login time is recorded → attendance is automatically marked.

System checks:

Login time (before 9:00 = ✅ On-time)

Between 9:01–10:00 = ⚠️ Late

After 10:00 = ❌ Absent

Automatically updates daily attendance table.

End of the day → logout time captured → total hours saved.

Rewards / streaks update auto-run at night (via cron job).
